This repository contains my solutions to Frontend Mentor challenges. Each project is a hands-on exercise to improve my front-end development skills, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. The challenges simulate real-world scenarios, helping me practice building professional, pixel-perfect UIs.
