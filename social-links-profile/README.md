## My Process

### Built With

I began by analyzing the Figma design, then structured the HTML before refining the layout with Flexbox. To challenge myself and improve my CSS skills, I chose to use only pure CSS without any libraries like Tailwind CSS. My focus was on:

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Flexbox for layout styling  

### What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of CSS Flexbox and revisited the transition property.
